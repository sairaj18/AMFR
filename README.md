Attendance Monitoring using Face Recognition

This project describes a method for Studentâ€™s Attendance System which will integrate
face recognition technology using deep learning algorithms. The system will recognize the
students present in the classroom and provide the list of present and absent students for the
lecture.
The primary technique used for the face detection is by using the algorithms of computer vision
and deep learning with python inbuilt packages of OpenCV. Once the model is trained on
different kinds of datasets, the project will help in identifying students present for the class.
Main problems with the existing methods such as Haar Cascade Classifier is its inability to
classify efficiently, it also depends on the quality of picture taken and the camera used to capture
the picture. With Open CV these hurdles can be overcome with inbuilt features.
